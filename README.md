_No bullshit. Quickly pin F3 information and statistics on your main HUD._

## ✨ What is QuickInfos ?

There are times when you need to check on your coordinates or your biome so you press F3 and your screen is blowing off of so much useless infos...

Sounds familiar ?

QuickInfos is a Minecraft Fabric mod that enable the possibility to pin essential gameplay infos right on your main HUD right from a single command.

```cmd
/quickinfos
```

## 🚀 Features & Design direction

- **Easy to Toggle** : designed for quick configuration
- **Sleek & Minimal** : designed for quick configuration
- **Full debug screen support & others** : I do try to add every changing values to the mod when asked
- **Every minecraft version support** : speak from itself, but I will make it work on every minecraft official version except snapshots
